Please add your pseudocode to this file
And a written explanation of your solution

For each letter in the input string as the first element:
    For each letter in the input string as the same or second element:
        Take the substring that starts at i and ends at j and assign it to a variable
        Add that variable to the array

Explanation of solution:
In the function consecutiveSubstrings(string), I have two loops, nested. The first gets the anchor element, then the second gets the next or same element.
It has to be the next or same element to allow for single character strings ("a" from "abc").
I then push the substrings into an array.

Time complexity:
O(n^2) (quadratic time)


Task 4:
1. Determine which aspect is scalable by looking into variables.
The aspects that are scalable is the string length, and the number of substrings and their lengths

2. Determine how that scalable element changes the code.
More characters leads to more loop iterations
